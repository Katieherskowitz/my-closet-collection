        <h1> ENTRY 1 -  SHOES BUT ALSO ME RAMBLING</h1>
        </a>
            <p> My first entry had to be something related to shoes. Shoes are definitely my favorite item in the world. It's been like this since I was a kid, and I think my favorite aspect about it is that my shoes show how far I and my style have progressed. Some shoes have remained the same. My converses are my lifeline. I'll always be a Vans girl. Some things never change. Somethings do. I transitioned from twinkle toes to crocs, Jordans, Nikes, flats, heels, and loafers. I've experimented with my style a lot, and seeing what I own today compared to when I was younger is still weird. Growing up has taught me what I enjoy and dislike about my style and comfort, and ultimately feeling whole in what I wear is something I will never get accustomed to, and I am sure it will alter throughout time. Enough about me; let's focus on shoes. I firmly believe that a great pair of shoes can transform any monotonous clothing. Plain sweatshirt and leggings? A nice patterned loafer or shoe. A denim and a top? Add a stylish flat or heel to it. I'm not a huge fan of simple white or black shoes; I prefer patterns, especially on my heels. I enjoy bold and funky because I genuinely believe it is what transforms the entire look. </p>

            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
