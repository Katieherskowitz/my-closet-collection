<p>I've recently talked about all of my favorite things, but one thing I haven't addressed is my love of thrifting. The majority of my clothes is from thrift stores, secondhand shops, or local businesses. I believe that many individuals are unaware of the negative consequences of excessive consumption, particularly in this day and age. Social media makes it so simple to constantly desire more and more. Companies like Amazon make it so simple to order something and receive it right away. However, this is extremely harmful to both the environment and individuals. Companies such as Shein, Romwe, Edikted, and Princess Polly are fast fashion brands, and many people shop at these brands without knowing the impact they have on so many things we love. i love thrfting so much because it truly feels like a treasure hunt every time I enter a store. I enjoy the pleasure of discovering one-of-a-kind pieces that tell a story—whether it's a vintage coat that adds flair to my collection or a quirky trinket item that makes me smile. It also allows me to exhibit my creativity, as I adore combining styles that suit my personality. Plus, knowing that my purchases help to promote sustainability and benefit local charity helps me feel good about my decisions. Thrifting is more than simply saving money; it's about creating a completely own collection while also being environmentally conscious.
