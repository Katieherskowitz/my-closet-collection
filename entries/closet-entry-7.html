  <h2> IN NEW YORK </h2> 
<p> I need to give new york a lot of credit. I had really funky and different style when i lived back in Miami but never like this. People are so inspiring here. I love people watching because its such an amazing source of inspiration. The fashion hereb is just so different and its so eclectic. Everyone expresses themsleves and can just be THEM. Its truly beauitful to see and i am so lucky i get to see it myself. Its brought out such a different side of me and has made me so much more confident. Its made me want to go out of my comfort zone with fashion and i absolutley love it. I have stopped using pinterest and istagram as sources of inspiration it teuly just comes from the people here and my own imagination. Every neighborhood has something unique to offer, from SoHo's expensive stores to Brooklyn's thrift shops, as well as the colorful street art that decorates the walls of the city. What actually distinguishes New York is its capacity to combine the ancient and the new, the classic and the avant-garde, resulting in a center of culture where fashion and art are more than simply industries; they are continually evolving forms of expression. It's a place where creativity knows no limitations, and being surrounded by that energy feels like you're always inspired.  </p>
