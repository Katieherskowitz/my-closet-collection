<p>My Key to thrfiting: Look through everything. and i mean everything. All the racks. all the piles. Even when it looks questionable. Know what you kind of want before you go. I always say this but we can truly find anything e want thrifted with a matter of time. Some people call it thrift manifesting. I think its funny but kinda true. Buy the funky stuff. I always say that thrifting gets me the most unique stuff ever. I go in the store mostly looking for cool things instead of basics. Be okay with a fix up. Every piece of clothing can be fixed. Sometimes you just have to see the vision. The ugliest thrings at the thrfit can be turned into the nicest. Thrifting is vital not only for helping the planet, but also for fostering originality and sustainability in fashion. By purchasing secondhand, we reduce waste and the need for fast fashion, both of which contribute considerably to pollution and material overconsumption. Thrift stores are a treasure mine of one-of-a-kind, frequently high-quality things that are no longer made, allowing us to create a wardrobe that stands out and tells a personal story.  This also helps build individuality and the stress of conforming to trends.   </p>
