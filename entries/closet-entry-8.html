<p>My Key to thrfiting: Look through everything. and i mean everything. All the racks. all the piles. Even when it looks questionable. Know what you kind of want before you go. I always say this but we can truly find anything e want thrifted with a matter of time. Some people call it thrift manifesting. I think its funny but kinda true. Buy the funky stuff. I always say that thrifting gets me the most unique stuff ever. I go in the store mostly looking for cool things instead of basics. Be okay with a fix up. Every piece of clothing can be fixed. Sometimes you just have to see the vision. The ugliest thrings at the thrfit can be turned into the nicest.  Â </p>
