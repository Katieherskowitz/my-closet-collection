<p> Why do I love fashion? There are many reasons. SOOOOOO many. It simply makes sense to me. I wake up excited to be able to choose my outfit. It was most likely inspired by my childhood love of shopping and purchasing items that made me happy. But I also enjoy being able to communicate how I feel with my clothes without saying anything. There is so much to learn from an outfit. It's not just about nice clothes for me; it's about how I feel, and dressing up typically boosts my confidence and makes me feel better, and at the end of the day, that's all that matters. The creative process of putting together outfits thrills me; it's like wearing art. I enjoy trying out new styles, playing with colors, and finding one-of-a-kind things that express who I am. Fashion also connects me with others; whether we're speaking about trends or bonding over our shared love of vintage treasures, it fosters a sense of community. It allows me to celebrate my originality while also embracing change, which I find quite gratifying.
