<h2>Bags have always been my favorite accessory. </h2>
<p> I'm particularly drawn to funky designs, with colorful patterns, unique shapes, and witty elements that speak to me. Bags are like a work of art that I can take with me on the go! When it comes to size of the bag. The bigger the bag the better. Small bags just don't cut it for me; they usually feel restrictive and impractical. </p>
  
  <p> I enjoy having enough room to carry all of my things and more! Plus they can make or break an outfit. While i love big purses all seasons of the year i think that small bags are more for summer and big bags are for winter/fall. There's something so amazing about finding a unique bag, one that sticks out because of its design, color, or craftsmanship. A unique purse, whether vintage, hand made, or even quirky adds personality and flair to any look. I adore how a statement purse can transform something as simple as trousers and a white tee into something fashionable and eye-catching. </p>
  
  <p>It's almost as if the purse becomes the focal point, capturing everyone's attention and elevating the look from ordinary to amazing. What's even better is that each bag has its own story—it's a work of art that you carry around as a representation of your particular style and individuality. The right bag can do so much more than just hold your essentials; it has the ability to elevate your mood and make you feel confident and stylish every time you wear it. </p>
