<p> Ive always been really hesitent to be really expressive with fashion. Im always hesistant to tell people i like it. I think a lot of people might think its stupid but i dont. Fashion has always made sense to me. Its always been something that i look foward to doing. Its never felt like work. Its just fun. Its fun to get all dolled up and show my personality through what i am wearing. I love showing my thrifted or vinatge finds and i love seeing people on the side of the street compliment eachother on there outfits. Its like a big community. Going to Parsons has also opened up my eyes to so many kinds of styles and unique outfits. It truly makes me feel so welcome and makes me feel like i can wear whatever i want which ive never felt in a school enviorment    </p>
