<p>For my third entry i want to talk about jewlery. Ever since i can remember i have always been a lover of all things jewelery. Ive never been a big fan of dainty pieces though. My eye alays sees bold and bright colors first. More than half of my jewlery is bold and big and usually stands out. I like it like this because i can put on a really simple outfit and still be unique because of my jewlery. I love love love thrifting and finding old jewlery. I think there is just something so special about it. They are also usually better quality and better looking then the jewlery that is made today. Some of my favorite places to find jelwery is back at home in Miami but there is also so many nyc shops like remniscnese and even the cheksea fkea. They are usually reasonably priced and very worth it. I love that when i get dressed i can also get dressed with my jewles. I love my little collection. </p>
