<p>Bags have always been my favorite accessory. I'm particularly drawn to funky designs, with colorful patterns, unique shapes, and witty elements that speak to me. Bags are like a work of art that I can take with me on the go! When it comes to size of the bag, I definitely fall into the "bigger is better" camp. Small bags just don't cut it for me; they usually feel restrictive and impractical. I enjoy having enough room to carry all of my things and more! Plus they can make or break an outfit. While i love big purses all seasons of the year i think that small bags are more for summer and big bags are for winter/fall. </p>
