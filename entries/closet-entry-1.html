  <p> My first entry had to be something related to shoes. Shoes are definitely my favorite item in the world. It's been like this since I was a kid, and I think my favorite aspect about it is that my shoes show how far I and my style have progressed. Some shoes have remained the same. My converses are my lifeline. I'll always be a Vans girl. Some things never change. Somethings do. I transitioned from twinkle toes to crocs, Jordans, Nikes, flats, heels, and loafers. I've experimented with my style a lot, and seeing what I own today compared to when I was younger is still weird. Growing up has taught me what I enjoy and dislike about my style and comfort, and ultimately feeling whole in what I wear is something I will never get accustomed to, and I am sure it will alter throughout time. Enough about me; let's focus on shoes. I firmly believe that a great pair of shoes can transform any monotonous clothing. Plain sweatshirt and leggings? A nice patterned loafer or shoe. A denim and a top? Add a stylish flat or heel to it. I'm not a huge fan of simple white or black shoes; I prefer patterns, especially on my heels. I enjoy bold and funky because I genuinely believe it is what transforms the entire look. </p>
